## Proposed built-in modules

Built-in modules is a proposed feature of the web platform, in the [Layered API](https://github.com/drufball/layered-apis), [JavaScript standard library](http://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/) and [import maps](https://github.com/domenic/import-maps) proposals.

Note that the modules in this document are often early drafts, and the names are not final. No built-in modules have shipped to the web at the time of writing this document.

### Conventions

- Current proposals share an idea of a shared module specifier prefix like `std:` or `@std/`. This document omits the module prefix, on the assumption that a common prefix will be used by all JS shared built-in modules. If multiple prefixes are used, then split this into separate documents for each namespace.
- Include built-in modules from both TC39 and web efforts (as they are sharing this new namespace, and this document could help coordination).
